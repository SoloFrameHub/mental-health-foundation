## **User Persona**

## **User Persona — Rachel, Wellness Seeker (main)**

Rachel is a busy professional in her late 30s balancing a demanding career with family responsibilities. She is seeking mental health support to manage anxiety and past trauma. Although familiar with traditional therapy, Rachel is looking for a more holistic and personalized approach to her well-being.

### **Problem that bothers your Persona**

Rachel struggles with persistent anxiety and unresolved trauma from years ago. These issues have been exacerbated by work stress and family obligations. She often feels overwhelmed, affecting her productivity and emotional well-being. Rachel first noticed her mental health declining when she took on a new role at work, increasing her stress levels. The feeling of 'always being on edge' and difficulty sleeping have become part of her daily routine. She feels trapped in a cycle that is hard to break. Despite trying self-help techniques and sporadic therapy sessions, Rachel hasn't found a sustainable solution. She wants to heal but feels skeptical about the effectiveness of traditional methods.

### **Pains that irritate your Persona**

* Constant sleep disturbances make her feel exhausted.  
* The fear of an impending breakdown at work is huge.  
* Emotional detachment is affecting her family relationships.  
* Frustration with lack of progress in personal therapy.  
* The social stigma surrounding mental health makes her hesitant to seek help.

### **Goal that your Persona wants to achieve**

Rachel aims to achieve a stress-free and balanced life where anxiety does not control her decisions or emotions. Her ultimate goal is to transform into a more resilient and self-aware individual. On a rational level, she wants to improve her professional performance and rebuild her strained family bonds. Her emotional pursuit is the sense of empowerment and freedom from her past trauma. Rachel envisions a future where she can handle daily pressures with ease and contribute authentically to her personal and professional life.

### **Benefits that your Persona craves**

* Restful sleep leading to increased energy.  
* Improved emotional well-being and resilience.  
* Stronger and more supportive family relationships.  
* Enhanced focus and productivity at work.  
* Greater self-confidence and personal satisfaction.

### **Status-quo solution that your Persona uses**

Rachel's current go-to solution involves browsing self-help books and articles while occasionally attending talk therapy sessions. These sessions offer temporary relief but do not delve deep enough into her subconscious issues. She has also tried meditation apps, which provide momentary calm yet lack the consistency needed for lasting change. Her busy schedule often leads her to postpone regular therapy, keeping her in a cycle of short-term fixes. Rachel's reliance on sporadic therapy and DIY mental health management tools reflects her hesitancy to commit fully to an intensive program until she finds one that resonates with her values and needs.

### **Context of your Persona about other solutions**

* Rachel is aware of mindfulness and meditation apps like Calm and Headspace.  
* She has considered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) but is skeptical about its personalized application.  
* She understands the role of medication but hesitates over potential side effects.  
* Friends have mentioned online therapy platforms like BetterHelp.  
* Rachel is starting to explore holistic health approaches through wellness blogs.

### **Event that triggered your Persona**

A particularly stressful quarter at work left Rachel on the edge, culminating in an anxiety attack during a family gathering. This incident was a wake-up call for her to seek serious help. Adding to this, her recent watch of a documentary about mental health deepened her understanding of the possibilities beyond traditional therapy. She realized the need for a professional intervention when self-help methods failed her. Rachel's increasing concern over her children's growing awareness of her mental state pushed her to look for comprehensive services that could offer structured guidance and support.

### **Barriers that slow down your Persona**

* Concerns about the cost of professional treatment.  
* Worry about finding a trustworthy and effective service.  
* Afraid of the commitment and time required for therapy.  
* Doubtful about the effectiveness of new treatment approaches.  
* Social stigma about mental health and fear of judgment.

### **Sales cycle of your Persona**

Rachel's decision-making process typically extends over several months. The end of a stressful work season or a notable personal event usually sparks her motivation to seek solutions. Her research involves online reviews, testimonials, and consultations with friends who have tried similar services. She takes careful notes of potential benefits and drawbacks before making any commitment. Given her hesitance, the assurance of ongoing support and a trial period might sway her towards making a quicker decision. Once convinced, she is likely to continue the services long-term, integrating them into her lifestyle.

## **User Persona — Jordan, Student (secondary)**

Jordan is a 21-year-old undergraduate balancing a heavy course load with part-time work and a budding social life. They live away from home for the first time and feel overwhelmed by academic expectations and independence. Jordan seeks private, flexible telehealth options that respect their need for convenience and cultural awareness.

### **Problem that bothers your Persona**

Jordan struggles with mounting academic stress, homesickness, and social anxiety. The sudden shift to independent living and tight deadlines triggers persistent worry and self-doubt. They often feel isolated despite being surrounded by peers. Deadlines for essays and exams amplify Jordan’s anxiety, leading to sleepless nights and difficulty concentrating. Over time, this has contributed to periods of low mood and rumination. They find it hard to ask for help due to fear of judgment and a perception that everyone else is handling life better. Attempts to cope—like journaling and meditation apps—provide brief relief but lack personalized guidance. Jordan worries that without structured support, the cycle of stress and burnout will continue.

### **Pains that irritate your Persona**

* Recurring all-nighters reduce focus and memory retention.  
* Social events feel draining, leading to isolation.  
* Low mood makes even simple tasks seem daunting.  
* Self-criticism after each mistake lowers self-esteem.  
* Fear that academic performance will slip irreversibly.

### **Goal that your Persona wants to achieve**

Jordan wants to build resilience and maintain a healthy balance between academics, work, and self-care. They aim to manage anxiety so it no longer disrupts sleep or concentration. Emotionally, Jordan seeks confidence in their ability to handle pressure and connect with peers without fear. On a rational level, they want improved grades and consistent performance. On an emotional level, they desire a sense of belonging and inner calm. Jordan hopes to integrate mental health practices seamlessly into their daily routine for lasting well-being.

### **Benefits that your Persona craves**

* Consistent restful sleep enhances energy and cognition.  
* Calmness during exams improves performance.  
* Healthier social interactions boost their support network.  
* Improved self-esteem fosters a growth mindset.  
* Balanced schedule reduces burnout and dropout risk.

### **Status-quo solution that your Persona uses**

Jordan’s current coping strategy relies on free campus counseling services, which have long waitlists and limited session lengths. They supplement this with mindfulness videos on YouTube and meditation apps for quick relief. These offer temporary calm but do not address deeper anxiety patterns. On particularly stressful days, Jordan resorts to binge-watching shows to distract themselves, which delays studying and worsens guilt. This patchwork approach leaves them feeling stuck in cycles of stress and recovery without sustained improvement.

### **Context of your Persona about other solutions**

* Aware of Headspace and Calm for guided meditation.  
* Considered university counseling but placed on a 6-week waitlist.  
* Read about CBT and thought journal apps might help.  
* Heard peers mention BetterHelp but unsure about privacy.  
* Seen social media posts about peer-support groups but doubtful they’re structured enough.

### **Event that triggered your Persona**

After missing two midterm deadlines and experiencing a panic attack in the library, Jordan realized self-management was no longer enough. The fear of failing courses and losing a scholarship became tangible. This crisis made them acknowledge the need for professional help. They recently saw a friend use a telehealth counseling service with positive results, highlighting how accessible care can be. Jordan felt both relief at discovering a discreet option and urgency to act before the semester spiraled further.

### **Barriers that slow down your Persona**

* Worry about insurance coverage and out-of-pocket costs.  
* Skepticism about digital therapy’s effectiveness.  
* Fear of peers discovering their mental health struggles.  
* Uncertainty about juggling therapy with a busy schedule.  
* Doubt about finding culturally competent providers.

### **Sales cycle of your Persona**

Jordan’s decision timeline aligns with key academic milestones. They typically begin searching after midterms or before finals, spanning one to two months from first search to booking an appointment. Stress peaks during these periods, making them more receptive to mental health offers. They rely heavily on peer recommendations, online reviews, and proof of flexibility like evening slots before committing. A free initial consultation or trial session can shorten their decision time. Once they find a service that fits their schedule and feels supportive, Jordan tends to stay for at least the semester.

She seeks a compassionate, personalized mental health service to finally break free from her trauma cycles.
