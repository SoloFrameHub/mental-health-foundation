              <p>From the moment you connect with David, you'll sense his genuine warmth and easygoing nature.

His honest, empathetic engagement helps you feel understood, not judged, as you take the first steps toward healing.</p>

              <h3>A Holistic Philosophy</h3>
              <p>Dave sees you as a whole person, not a collection of symptoms. He believes every aspect of your life—your stressors, relationships, lifestyle habits, and spiritual needs—shapes your mental health. Before recommending medication, he'll gently explore where you're stuck and what strengths you can build on. If medicine becomes part of your journey, he treats it as one tool among many, always ensuring you understand why it's prescribed and how it supports your long-term goals.</p>

              <h3>Areas of Expertise</h3>
              <p>Over the years, Dave has helped people overcome low self-esteem, social anxiety, and complex trauma like PTSD. He's equally skilled supporting those facing bipolar disorder, ADHD, depression, or generalized anxiety. His LGBTQ+-affirming approach creates a safe space where you can share your story without fear. Whether you're struggling to set boundaries in relationships or feeling overwhelmed by inner critics, Dave's evidence-based practices are tailored to your unique needs. He utilizes a variety of therapeutic modalities, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Interpersonal Therapy (IPT), Mindfulness, and Behavioral Activation, always focusing on the person, not just the diagnosis.</p>

              <h3>Professional Journey</h3>
              <p>You'll benefit from Dave's wide-ranging background in crisis intervention, psychiatric inpatient care, and correctional mental health services. He's guided countless individuals through outpatient community clinics and substance-use treatment programs, always prioritizing respect and dignity. As a licensed telehealth provider, Dave makes it simple to fit high-quality mental health support into your busy life—so you never have to choose between your well-being and your schedule. He is licensed in Ohio and offers both virtual and in-person appointments.</p>

                "You're the boss of your treatment. Every step of your plan is co-created: you'll understand why each strategy or medication is recommended, and you'll have the final say."

              <p>Autumn is currently deepening her expertise through a functional psychiatry program, exploring how nutritional imbalances and genetic variations can fuel symptoms of anxiety, depression, or brain fog.
