                <h2>Welcome & Context</h2>
                <div class="introduction-content">
                    <p>The impact of technology and screen time on family mental health has become increasingly significant, with research revealing both positive and negative effects depending on usage patterns, content quality, and family management strategies. Excessive screen time correlates with increased rates of anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and attention difficulties in children, while thoughtful technology use can enhance learning, creativity, and social connection. The key lies in establishing healthy boundaries that maximize benefits while minimizing potential harm, with studies showing that families who implement structured screen time guidelines demonstrate better overall mental health outcomes and stronger family relationships.</p>
                    <p>Creating a family media plan requires understanding developmental differences in how technology affects children of different ages, from toddlers who benefit most from interactive, educational content used with parents to adolescents who need guidance in navigating social media and online relationships while maintaining privacy and autonomy. Research indicates that co-viewing and discussing digital content enhances its educational value while reducing potential negative impacts, transforming passive consumption into active learning experiences that strengthen family bonds. Families learn to establish tech-free zones and times, such as during meals and before bedtime, that protect important family interactions and healthy sleep patterns.</p>
                    <p>The broader concept of digital wellness encompasses not just screen time limits but also online safety, digital citizenship, and helping children develop healthy relationships with technology that will serve them throughout their lives. This includes teaching critical thinking about online content, understanding privacy and safety in digital environments, recognizing signs of cyberbullying or online harassment, and modeling healthy technology use as parents. Families develop strategies for managing technology during stressful periods, using apps and tools that support rather than undermine mental health, and maintaining human connection in an increasingly digital world. This lesson emphasizes that technology can serve as a tool for family mental health when used intentionally, while also acknowledging the need for conscious boundaries that protect the family's psychological wellbeing and interpersonal relationships.</p>
