                <h2>Welcome & Context</h2>
                <div class="introduction-content">
                    <p>Life transitions represent periods of increased vulnerability for family mental health, as changes in routine, roles, relationships, or living situations can challenge existing coping strategies and create stress that affects all family members. Research indicates that families experiencing major transitions—such as moves, job changes, divorce, death, new babies, or children leaving home—show temporarily increased rates of anxiety, depression, and interpersonal conflict, but that families who actively prepare for and navigate transitions demonstrate better outcomes and often emerge stronger from the experience. Understanding transitions as normal but challenging parts of family life helps normalize the stress while emphasizing the importance of additional support during these periods.</p>
                    <p>Different types of transitions require different family responses, with anticipated changes allowing for preparation and gradual adjustment, while unexpected transitions may require crisis management skills and rapid adaptation strategies. Studies show that children are particularly affected by family transitions, often experiencing regression in previously mastered skills, changes in behavior, or emotional difficulties as they process the implications of change for their sense of security and predictability. However, children also demonstrate remarkable resilience when families provide consistent emotional support, clear communication about changes, and opportunities for the child to maintain some control and continuity during transitional periods.</p>
                    <p>Developing family transition skills involves creating frameworks for managing change that can be applied to various situations, including preparation strategies, communication approaches, and ongoing support systems that help families navigate uncertainty while maintaining connection and stability. Families learn to identify the stages of transition, recognize common emotional responses, and implement specific strategies for supporting each family member's adjustment process. This includes creating new routines and traditions that provide stability, maintaining important connections and continuities from the previous situation, and celebrating successful adaptation to change. This lesson emphasizes that while transitions are inherently stressful, they also represent opportunities for growth, increased resilience, and positive change when families approach them with preparation, support, and confidence in their ability to adapt and thrive in new circumstances.</p>
