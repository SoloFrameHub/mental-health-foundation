# QUICK COPY-PASTE FOR NEW CLAUDE SESSIONS

I already have a working anxiety body map course. DO NOT rebuild it.

Working files location:
`/github-deployment/anxiety-toolkit/lesson-1-1-ANATOMICALLY-CORRECT.html`

Body images location:
`/github-deployment/anxiety-toolkit/images/full-body-image.jpg`

RULES:
1. Hearts go in CHESTS not stomachs
2. Stomachs go in BELLIES not groins  
3. Hands go on ARMS not legs
4. Humans have TWO legs not one

If you want to help:
- Use my EXISTING files
- Deploy what I ALREADY built
- Stop creating new "solutions"
- Read STOP-PUTTING-ORGANS-IN-WRONG-PLACES.md

The course works. Just deploy it:
`bash JUST-DEPLOY-IT.sh`

DO NOT:
- Create state management systems
- Build progress trackers
- Make new automation scripts
- "Fix" the body map
- Rebuild anything

The anatomy is correct. The files work. Deploy them.
