                <h2>Welcome to Mental Health First Aid Training</h2>
                <div class="introduction-content">
                    <p><strong>Mental health first aid skills enable you to recognize early warning signs of psychological distress, provide initial support during mental health crises, and connect struggling teammates with appropriate professional resources.</strong> Research shows that peer-delivered first aid can significantly improve outcomes and reduce stigma compared to exclusively professional intervention models, with athletes often first disclosing mental health concerns to teammates rather than coaches or professional staff. This makes peer first aid skills crucial for early intervention and appropriate resource connection in athletic contexts.</p>

                    <p><strong>The evidence is clear:</strong> Athletic environments create unique mental health risks including performance pressure, injury concerns, identity challenges, and intense interpersonal relationships, while also providing opportunities for early detection through daily close contact and shared experiences. Studies demonstrate that trained peer responders can recognize mental health crises 3-4 weeks earlier than untrained individuals, significantly improving treatment outcomes and reducing crisis severity. The ALGEE framework (Assess, Listen, Give reassurance, Encourage professional help, Encourage self-help) provides structured approach to mental health first aid that balances supportive presence with appropriate boundary-setting.</p>

                    <p><strong>In this lesson, you'll:</strong> Learn to recognize warning signs for depression, anxiety, eating disorders, substance abuse, and suicide risk as they may appear in athletic contexts, master the ALGEE protocol for providing psychological first aid without attempting amateur diagnosis or treatment, practice responding to realistic mental health crisis scenarios with appropriate supportive language and actions, understand when situations require immediate professional intervention and how to access emergency services, and develop knowledge of available resources including campus counseling, community mental health providers, and crisis intervention hotlines specific to athletic populations.</p>

                        <p>Mental health first aid fills the critical gap between when someone first experiences distress and when they receive professional treatment, with research showing that early intervention during this window significantly improves long-term outcomes and reduces crisis severity. Athletes often disclose mental health concerns to teammates before approaching coaches or professionals due to trust, daily contact, and fear of negative consequences from authority figures, making peer first aid skills essential for comprehensive team mental health support.</p>

                                <p>Mental health first aid provides initial support and resource connection—NOT diagnosis or treatment. Your role is to offer caring presence, help ensure safety, provide information about available resources, and encourage professional help-seeking.

                                <p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> Don't minimize ("Others have it worse"), don't problem-solve immediately, don't share your own story to compare, don't judge their emotions or coping methods.</p>
