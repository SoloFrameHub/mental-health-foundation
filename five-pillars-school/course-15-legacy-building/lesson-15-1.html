                        <h3>📚 Your Life Story as Wisdom Foundation</h3>
                        <p>Every experience, challenge, and triumph in your life has contributed to a unique perspective that others can benefit from. Research in developmental psychology demonstrates that lived experience creates practical wisdom that formal education cannot replicate. Your personal history—including failures and difficulties—forms the foundation of authentic teaching that resonates with others facing similar challenges.</p>

                        <p>Common obstacles prevent people from recognizing their wisdom value: imposter syndrome, belief you need external success markers, cultural messages devaluing experience over credentials. Research shows these barriers are psychological rather than reality-based. Understanding and addressing these blocks is essential for stepping into your role as wisdom sharer.</p>

The inventory examines: transformative life experiences, skills developed through challenges, recurring themes in your problem-solving, insights from relationship navigation, professional expertise gained through practice, and values clarified through difficult decisions. This becomes your foundation for all legacy-building activities.</p>
