                <h2>Understanding Your Relationship Blueprint</h2>
                <div class="introduction-content">
                    <p><strong>Welcome to one of the most transformative lessons in this course.</strong> You're about to discover the hidden blueprint that shapes all your relationships—your attachment style. Developed in early childhood through interactions with caregivers, your attachment style influences how you trust others, express emotions, seek closeness, and respond to conflict. Understanding this invisible force helps you recognize patterns, anticipate triggers, and create more secure connections throughout your life.</p>

                    <p><strong>The research foundation is solid:</strong> Attachment theory, pioneered by John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth in the 1960s-70s and extended to adult relationships by Hazan and Shaver in 1987, reveals that early caregiving experiences create "internal working models" of relationships. These models—mental representations of self and others—guide expectations, behaviors, and emotional responses in adult relationships. Studies show 50-60% of adults have secure attachment, while 40-50% exhibit insecure patterns (anxious, avoidant, or fearful). The transformative discovery: attachment styles can change through corrective relationship experiences, earning security through new connections.</p>

                    <p><strong>In this lesson, you'll:</strong> Complete a validated attachment style assessment to identify your primary pattern, explore the four attachment styles with brain-based explanations of how each develops, understand how your attachment style manifests in friendships, romantic relationships, and workplace dynamics, learn about "earned security"—how positive relationship experiences can transform insecure patterns, and develop strategies tailored to your attachment style for building healthier connections.</p>

                        <p>This lesson draws on John Bowlby's groundbreaking attachment theory (1960s), Mary Ainsworth's Strange Situation research identifying attachment patterns (1970s), Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver's extension to adult romantic attachment (1987), and Kim Bartholomew's four-category model (1990). Current neurobiological research reveals attachment patterns reflect neural pathways in emotion regulation and social processing regions, with demonstrated neuroplasticity showing these patterns can be rewired through new relationship experiences.</p>

                        <h3>🧠 What is Attachment Theory?</h3>
                        <p>Attachment theory explains how early relationships with caregivers shape lifelong patterns of relating to others. As infants, we depend completely on caregivers for survival. Through thousands of interactions—are our cries answered? are we comforted when distressed? are our needs met consistently?—we develop expectations about relationships. These expectations become internal working models: mental representations of whether we're worthy of love and whether others are reliable and trustworthy.</p>

                                <h4>🔵 Secure Attachment (50-60% of adults)</h4>
                                <p><strong>Early Experience:</strong> Caregivers responsive, consistent, attuned to needs. Child learns: "I am worthy, others are reliable, the world is safe."</p>
                                <p><strong>Adult Patterns:</strong> Comfortable with intimacy and independence. Trust others, communicate needs directly, regulate emotions effectively. Seek support when distressed and provide it to others. Form satisfying relationships.</p>
                                <p><strong>Relationship Style:</strong> "I'm comfortable depending on others and having others depend on me. I don't worry about being abandoned or someone getting too close."</p>

                                <p><strong>Early Experience:</strong> Caregivers inconsistent—sometimes responsive, sometimes unavailable. Child learns: "I need to amplify signals to get attention. Love is unpredictable."</p>
                                <p><strong>Adult Patterns:</strong> Strong desire for closeness but fear of abandonment. Hypervigilant to relationship threats, seek reassurance frequently, emotionally reactive. Fear rejection, may appear "clingy" or demanding.</p>
                                <p><strong>Relationship Style:</strong> "I worry that others don't really love me or won't want to stay. I want to merge completely with another person, which sometimes scares them away."</p>

                                <p><strong>Adult Patterns:</strong> Value independence highly, uncomfortable with intimacy and emotional expression. Minimize attachment needs, suppress emotions, maintain distance. May appear self-sufficient but experience hidden loneliness.</p>
                                <p><strong>Relationship Style:</strong> "I'm comfortable without close relationships. Independence is very important to me. I prefer not to depend on others or have them depend on me."</p>

                                <p><strong>Adult Patterns:</strong> Want closeness but fear getting hurt. Approach-avoidance conflict—desire intimacy but pull away when it's offered. Trust issues, emotional dysregulation, conflicted about relationships.</p>
                                <p><strong>Relationship Style:</strong> "I want to be close to others but find it difficult to trust them. I worry I'll be hurt if I allow myself to become too close."</p>
