                <h2>Understanding the Limits of Connection</h2>
                <div class="introduction-content">
                    <p><strong>How many real friends can you have?</strong> British anthropologist Robin Dunbar's research reveals a surprising answer: about 150 meaningful connections is the cognitive limit for most humans. This "Dunbar's Number" reflects the maximum number of people with whom you can maintain stable social relationships—people you know personally, understand their relation to others, and can keep track of their lives. Beyond 150, relationships become increasingly superficial. Understanding this limit liberates you from the pressure to maintain hundreds of connections and refocuses attention on relationship quality.</p>

                    <p><strong>The science reveals layered connections:</strong> Dunbar's research identifies concentric circles of relationship intimacy: 5 intimate connections (closest confidants), 15 close friends (strong emotional bonds), 50 good friends (regular contact and support), 150 meaningful connections (recognizable relationships), and 500+ acquaintances (familiar faces). Each layer requires different time investment—intimate relationships demand 40% of your social time for just 5 people, while the next 10 people require another 20%. The Harvard Study of Adult Development, tracking participants for 75+ years, confirms that relationship quality predicts happiness and health far more than quantity.</p>

                    <p><strong>In this lesson, you'll:</strong> Explore Dunbar's Number and the cognitive neuroscience behind relationship limits, map your current relationships into the five connection layers to identify where you're investing energy, understand quality indicators that distinguish meaningful from superficial connections, learn about time scarcity and why deeper relationships require consistent investment, and develop a strategic approach to prioritizing high-quality connections that energize rather than drain you.</p>

                        <h3>🧠 The Social Brain Hypothesis</h3>
                        <p>Robin Dunbar discovered a correlation between primate neocortex size and social group size. Larger, more complex brains support larger social networks. Applying this relationship to humans, Dunbar predicted we can maintain about 150 stable relationships—and research has repeatedly confirmed this number across hunter-gatherer societies, military units, company sizes, and modern social networks. Your brain has finite cognitive resources for tracking relationships, remembering details, understanding social dynamics, and maintaining emotional connections.</p>
