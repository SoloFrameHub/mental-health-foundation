                <h2>Welcome to CBT Fundamentals</h2>
                <div class="introduction-content">
                    <p><strong>Welcome to the foundational principle of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy—the Cognitive Triangle.</strong> This revolutionary framework, developed by Dr. Aaron Beck in the 1960s, reveals how your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors continuously influence each other in dynamic feedback loops. Understanding this interconnection empowers you to break free from cycles of negative thinking and emotional distress by recognizing that you have multiple intervention points for creating positive change.</p>

                    <p><strong>The science is clear:</strong> Research from the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy and the National Institute of Mental Health demonstrates that CBT reduces depression symptoms by 50-60% and improves anxiety disorders in 60-75% of patients. The cognitive triangle model has been validated in over 2,000 clinical trials, showing that changing thoughts, emotions, or behaviors at any point in the triangle automatically influences the other components. Neuroplasticity research confirms that your brain can rewire itself at any age, creating new neural pathways that support healthier thinking patterns and emotional regulation.</p>

                    <p><strong>In this lesson, you'll:</strong> Map your personal cognitive triangle to understand how specific thoughts trigger emotional responses and behavioral choices, identify which intervention point (thoughts, feelings, or behaviors) is most accessible for you to create change, practice distinguishing between situations and interpretations to recognize cognitive mediation, and develop metacognitive awareness that transforms how you experience challenging situations in daily life.</p>

                        <p>The cognitive triangle represents the core theoretical framework of CBT, originating from Aaron Beck's pioneering work at the Beck Institute. Meta-analyses published by the American Psychiatric Association confirm that triangle-based CBT interventions produce lasting changes in neural activation patterns, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (executive function) and amygdala (emotional processing). Oxford Centre for Anxiety Disorders research demonstrates that understanding the thought-emotion-behavior connection increases treatment adherence by 65% and accelerates symptom reduction through enhanced self-awareness and targeted intervention selection.</p>
