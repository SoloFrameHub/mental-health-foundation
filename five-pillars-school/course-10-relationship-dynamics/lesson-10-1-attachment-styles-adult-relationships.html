                <div class="introduction-content">
                    <p><strong>Welcome to your transformative journey exploring attachment theory and its profound impact on adult relationships.</strong> This lesson reveals how your earliest relationships with caregivers created internal working models that continue to influence how you approach intimacy, handle conflict, and navigate emotional regulation in your romantic partnerships. You'll discover that attachment isn't destiny—understanding your patterns opens the door to earned security and healthier connection.</p>

                    <p><strong>The science is compelling:</strong> Research demonstrates that approximately 60% of adults have secure attachment styles, while 20% show anxious-preoccupied patterns and 20% demonstrate avoidant attachment tendencies. Studies reveal that securely attached individuals experience 40% lower rates of anxiety and depression, report higher relationship satisfaction, and demonstrate more effective communication during conflict. However, the groundbreaking insight is that attachment styles can evolve—earned security through positive adult relationships and therapeutic work is not only possible but common.</p>

                    <p><strong>In this lesson, you'll:</strong> Complete a comprehensive Attachment Style Assessment to identify your primary attachment pattern and understand its origins, explore how secure, anxious, avoidant, and disorganized attachment styles manifest in adult romantic relationships, discover your specific attachment triggers and how they activate defensive behaviors, learn research-based strategies for moving toward earned security regardless of your childhood experiences, and develop practical communication tools for discussing attachment needs with your partner to create greater safety and connection.</p>

                        <h3>💕 Why Attachment Shapes Adult Love</h3>
                        <p>Attachment theory explains how our earliest relationships with caregivers create internal working models—mental representations of ourselves, others, and relationships—that profoundly influence how we approach intimacy, handle conflict, and regulate emotions in adult romantic partnerships. When caregivers consistently respond to an infant's needs with warmth and reliability, secure attachment develops, creating a template for healthy adult relationships characterized by trust, effective communication, and emotional resilience.</p>

                                <h4>💚 Secure Attachment (60% of population)</h4>
                                <p><strong>Core Characteristics:</strong> Comfortable with intimacy and interdependence, effective communication during conflict, ability to seek and provide support appropriately, balanced autonomy and connection, trust in partner's availability and responsiveness.</p>
                                <p><strong>Internal Working Model:</strong> "I am worthy of love and care. Others are generally trustworthy and responsive to my needs. Relationships are safe and rewarding."</p>
                                <p><strong>In Relationships:</strong> Securely attached individuals navigate relationship challenges with resilience, communicate needs directly, respond empathetically to partners, and maintain balanced perspectives during conflicts.</p>

                                <p><strong>Core Characteristics:</strong> Fear of abandonment and rejection, tendency toward protest behaviors when feeling disconnected, difficulty self-soothing during relationship stress, hypervigilance to relationship threats, seeking excessive reassurance.</p>
                                <p><strong>Internal Working Model:</strong> "I need others desperately, but I'm not sure they'll be there for me. I must work hard to maintain connection or risk being abandoned."</p>
                                <p><strong>In Relationships:</strong> Anxiously attached individuals may become emotionally demanding, interpret neutral behaviors as rejection, struggle with independence, and experience intense emotional reactions to perceived distance or disconnection.</p>

                                <p><strong>Core Characteristics:</strong> Discomfort with intimacy and emotional closeness, preference for independence over interdependence, difficulty expressing vulnerability, tendency to minimize relationship importance, deactivation of attachment needs during stress.</p>
                                <p><strong>Internal Working Model:</strong> "I don't need others. Depending on people is weak or dangerous. I'm better off handling things myself."</p>
                                <p><strong>In Relationships:</strong> Avoidantly attached individuals may withdraw during conflict, struggle to express emotions, prioritize work or hobbies over relationship time, and feel suffocated by partners' needs for closeness.</p>

                                <p><strong>Internal Working Model:</strong> "I desperately need connection, but closeness feels dangerous. People I love might hurt me."</p>
                                <p><strong>In Relationships:</strong> Individuals with disorganized attachment may experience intense push-pull dynamics, struggle with trust even in safe relationships, and benefit significantly from trauma-informed therapy.</p>
