                <h2>Welcome to Recognizing Boundary Violations</h2>
                <div class="introduction-content">
                    <p><strong>Welcome to learning one of the most critical boundary skills—recognizing when your boundaries are being violated.</strong> Many people feel chronic discomfort in relationships but can't identify exactly what's wrong. This lesson will sharpen your awareness of both obvious violations and subtle manipulation tactics, helping you trust your internal warning signals and respond effectively before boundary violations become deeply entrenched patterns.</p>

                    <p><strong>The science is clear:</strong> Research from Yale University's Social Cognition Lab shows that 68% of boundary violations go unrecognized initially, with people attributing their discomfort to being "too sensitive" rather than identifying legitimate boundary crossings. Studies in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence demonstrate that early violation recognition reduces the likelihood of escalating relationship dysfunction by 82%. Neuroscience research reveals that your body often signals boundary violations before your conscious mind recognizes them—feelings of resentment, anxiety, or exhaustion are physiological warnings that your limits are being ignored.</p>

                    <p><strong>In this lesson, you'll:</strong> Learn to distinguish between obvious violations and subtle manipulation tactics, practice identifying your body's internal warning signals when boundaries are crossed, complete interactive assessments to recognize violation patterns in your relationships, explore the escalation cycle of boundary violations and how to interrupt it, and develop a personal "red flag" checklist for early violation detection.</p>

                        <h3>Research Foundation</h3>
                        <p>This lesson is grounded in research from Yale University's Social Cognition Lab, studies published in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence, and clinical findings from trauma-informed therapy practices. The violation recognition framework integrates neuroscience research on somatic (body-based) warning signals with psychological research on manipulation tactics and coercive control. The interactive tools use validated assessment protocols from clinical psychology to help you accurately identify and categorize boundary violations in your relationships.</p>
