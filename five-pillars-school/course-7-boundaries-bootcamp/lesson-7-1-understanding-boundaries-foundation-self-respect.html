                <h2>Welcome to Boundaries Bootcamp</h2>
                <div class="introduction-content">
                    <p><strong>Welcome to your transformative journey into the foundation of healthy relationships and self-respect.</strong> This lesson begins your exploration of boundaries—the invisible but powerful lines that define where you end and others begin. You'll discover that boundaries aren't selfish barriers that push people away; they're essential structures that protect your well-being while actually strengthening your relationships through mutual respect and authentic connection.</p>

                    <p><strong>The science is clear:</strong> Research from the American Psychological Association demonstrates that individuals with healthy boundaries report 47% higher relationship satisfaction and significantly lower rates of anxiety, depression, and burnout. Studies published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology show that boundary-setting is directly correlated with self-esteem, emotional stability, and life satisfaction. Psychologists at Stanford University have found that people who maintain clear boundaries experience less resentment, better work-life balance, and more authentic relationships compared to those with weak or absent boundaries.</p>

                    <p><strong>In this lesson, you'll:</strong> Complete an interactive boundary health assessment across four key areas (physical, emotional, mental, and time), explore the critical differences between healthy boundaries and isolating walls, discover how boundaries protect your well-being while enabling authentic connection, track your understanding through personalized metrics, and reflect deeply on your current boundary patterns and future growth areas.</p>
