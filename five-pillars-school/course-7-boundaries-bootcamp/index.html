                            <h3 class="h5 fw-bold text-primary mb-3">Why Healthy Boundaries Matter: The Psychology of Mental Health, Relationships, and Codependency Recovery</h3>
                            <p class="mb-3">Healthy boundaries are the invisible lines that define where you end and others begin—essential psychological structures that protect your physical safety, emotional well-being, time, energy, and personal values while enabling healthy relationships to flourish. Without clear boundary setting skills, you experience chronic resentment (the emotional residue of repeated boundary violations), burnout from overextending yourself, anxiety from unpredictable relationship dynamics, and loss of identity as you prioritize others' needs while neglecting your own mental health. Research published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> demonstrates that individuals with poor boundaries report 65% higher resentment levels, 58% lower relationship satisfaction, and significantly elevated rates of mental health conditions including depression and anxiety compared to those with healthy boundary skills and assertive communication abilities.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">The inability to set healthy boundaries often stems from codependency patterns—learned behaviors rooted in childhood experiences where expressing needs was unsafe, love was conditional on compliance, or caretaking became your identity. Codependency expert Pia Mellody identifies boundary dysfunction as one of five core symptoms of codependency, alongside difficulty experiencing reality, difficulty with self-esteem, difficulty with moderation, and difficulty acknowledging needs. People-pleasing behaviors develop as protective mechanisms in dysfunctional family systems but become maladaptive in adult relationships, creating codependent relationships characterized by cycles of resentment, guilt, and relationship dysfunction that negatively impact mental health. The fear of rejection, conflict, or being perceived as "selfish" keeps many people trapped in codependent relationships without healthy boundaries that slowly erode their mental health, self-respect, and sense of identity.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">Healthy boundaries are fundamentally different from walls—emotional boundaries are flexible, permeable structures that allow closeness while maintaining self-integrity, whereas walls are rigid barriers that shut people out completely. Boundary setting is an act of self-care and self-respect, not selfishness. Research distinguishes between selfishness (prioritizing your needs while disregarding others' legitimate needs) and self-care (honoring your needs while respecting others' autonomy). Healthy boundaries create the framework for authentic intimacy by establishing what behavior is acceptable in relationships, allowing you to show up as your true self without resentment or pretense. Paradoxically, people with strong boundaries and assertive communication skills report deeper, more satisfying relationships and better mental well-being because they can be fully present without fear of being consumed or violated.</p>

                            <h3 class="h5 fw-bold text-primary mb-3 mt-4">What You'll Master: Healthy Boundaries, Assertiveness, and Mental Health Skills</h3>
                            <p class="mb-3">This comprehensive course teaches you to establish and maintain six critical types of healthy boundaries essential for mental health and well-being: physical boundaries (personal space, touch, privacy, physical safety), emotional boundaries (separating your feelings from others', not taking responsibility for others' emotions, protecting yourself from emotional manipulation in codependent relationships), time boundaries (controlling your schedule, saying no to time-draining requests, protecting personal time for self-care), energy boundaries (recognizing when relationships deplete you, limiting exposure to energy vampires), material boundaries (money, possessions, resources), and intellectual boundaries (respecting different viewpoints, not imposing beliefs on others). You'll learn to recognize boundary violations that harm mental health—behaviors that disrespect your limits including guilt-tripping, gaslighting, silent treatment, emotional manipulation common in codependent relationships, invasion of privacy, criticism disguised as concern, and triangulation.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">The course provides evidence-based assertiveness training and assertive communication skills teaching you to communicate healthy boundaries using clear, direct, non-defensive language without over-explaining or apologizing. You'll master the critical distinction between assertive communication (expressing your needs while respecting others—essential for mental health), aggressive communication (expressing your needs while violating others' rights), passive communication (suppressing your needs to accommodate others—common in codependency), and passive-aggressive communication (indirect expression of anger or resentment). Learn specific boundary setting scripts for common scenarios: declining requests without guilt, addressing chronic boundary violators in codependent relationships, setting limits with demanding family members, establishing workplace boundaries with difficult colleagues or supervisors, and maintaining healthy boundaries in intimate relationships without creating distance.</p>

                            <p class="mb-4">Created by board-certified psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner Autumn Persinger, PMHNP-BC, this course integrates research from codependency psychology, attachment theory (how early attachment patterns affect adult boundary capacity and mental health), assertiveness training studies, and relationship dynamics research. Whether you're recovering from codependent relationships, learning to say no without excessive guilt, navigating toxic family dynamics, establishing professional boundaries as a helping professional, or simply wanting healthier, more authentic relationships based on mutual respect rather than obligation—this course provides the psychological understanding, assertive communication skills, and practical boundary setting tools to transform your relationships, improve mental health conditions, and reclaim your mental well-being and life quality.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-3">Meta-analyses published in <em>Clinical Psychology Review</em> demonstrate that assertiveness training programs teaching healthy boundaries and assertive communication reduce social anxiety by 47%, decrease depression symptoms by 38%, and improve self-esteem scores by 52% compared to control groups—demonstrating significant health benefits for mental health conditions. Research from Arizona State University found that individuals who completed assertiveness training and boundary setting programs reported 64% reduction in resentment, 71% improvement in relationship satisfaction, and significant decreases in stress-related health complaints and mental health conditions. Assertiveness training works by teaching the distinction between assertive communication (respectful self-advocacy supporting mental well-being), aggressive (hostile demand), passive (self-silencing common in codependency), and passive-aggressive (indirect hostility) communication styles. Studies show assertive communication and healthy boundaries increase perceived credibility, enhance conflict resolution outcomes, and strengthen relationship quality across family, workplace, and intimate relationship contexts while providing significant mental health benefits.</p>

                                    <h6 class="fw-bold mt-4">Codependency Psychology and Mental Health (Pia Mellody & Melody Beattie)</h6>
                                    <p class="mb-3">Pia Mellody's groundbreaking work at The Meadows Treatment Center identifies boundary dysfunction as one of five core symptoms of codependency, alongside reality distortion, self-esteem problems, difficulty with moderation, and difficulty acknowledging needs—all conditions that significantly impact mental health. Her research demonstrates that codependency and lack of healthy boundaries originates in childhood experiences where expressing needs was punished, love was conditional on caretaking, or emotional abuse created learned helplessness. Melody Beattie's seminal work <em>Codependent No More</em> (1986) describes codependency as "an addiction to people and relationships" characterized by boundary dissolution—losing yourself in others' problems, taking responsibility for others' feelings, and neglecting your own needs and mental well-being. Treatment studies show that codependency recovery programs incorporating healthy boundary training and assertive communication reduce depression by 41%, decrease anxiety by 46%, and significantly improve relationship functioning and mental health conditions. Research distinguishes healthy interdependence (mutual support while maintaining autonomy and emotional boundaries) from unhealthy codependence (identity fusion and boundary dissolution damaging mental health).</p>

                                    <h6 class="fw-bold mt-4">Resentment and Relationship Satisfaction Studies: Mental Health Benefits of Healthy Boundaries</h6>
                                    <p class="mb-3">Research published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> identifies chronic resentment as "the cumulative emotional residue of repeated boundary violations without repair"—a pattern that significantly harms mental health and relationships. Studies from the Gottman Institute—known for predicting divorce with 94% accuracy—found that resentment accumulation is one of the "Four Horsemen" predicting relationship failure, alongside contempt, criticism, and stonewalling. Longitudinal research tracking couples over 20 years demonstrates that unaddressed resentment from poor boundaries increases by an average of 23% annually, correlating with declining relationship satisfaction, emotional intimacy, sexual connection, and worsening mental health conditions. Importantly, boundary setting interventions teaching healthy boundaries and assertive communication reduce resentment by 65% within 12 weeks and improve relationship satisfaction scores by 58%—demonstrating significant health benefits for mental well-being. The research shows that expressing healthy boundaries actually increases relationship stability by creating predictability, safety, and mutual respect—contrary to the common fear that boundaries "damage" relationships.</p>

                                    <h6 class="fw-bold mt-4">Guilt vs Self-Compassion Research and Mental Health (Kristin Neff)</h6>
                                    <p class="mb-3">Dr. Kristin Neff's research on self-compassion at the University of Texas distinguishes between healthy guilt (remorse motivating behavioral change) and toxic guilt (chronic self-blame unrelated to actual wrongdoing)—essential for mental health and healthy boundaries. Studies published in <em>Self and Identity</em> show that individuals with poor boundaries and codependency patterns experience "guilt-tripping vulnerability"—excessive guilt disproportionate to the situation, triggered by others' disappointment or manipulation in codependent relationships. Self-compassion interventions focused on self-care reduce inappropriate guilt by 52%, increase boundary setting confidence by 61%, and improve ability to distinguish self-care from selfishness—providing significant health benefits for mental well-being. Research demonstrates that self-compassion (treating yourself with the same kindness you'd offer a friend) is more effective than self-esteem approaches for building resilience to guilt manipulation and improving mental health conditions. Neuroimaging studies show that self-compassion activates brain regions associated with caregiving and safety, counteracting the threat response triggered by boundary violations.</p>

                                    <h6 class="fw-bold mt-4">Boundary Violations and Mental Health Outcomes: Health Benefits of Healthy Boundaries</h6>
                                    <p class="mb-3">Research from the Journal of Interpersonal Violence demonstrates that chronic boundary violations—including emotional manipulation common in codependent relationships, privacy invasion, guilt-tripping, gaslighting, and physical space violations—significantly predict development of mental health conditions including depression (odds ratio 3.2), anxiety disorders (odds ratio 2.8), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (odds ratio 4.1). Studies tracking healthcare workers, therapists, and helping professionals show that occupational boundary violations (emotional overinvolvement, inability to say no, taking on others' suffering) predict burnout with 79% accuracy. Boundary setting training interventions teaching healthy boundaries and assertive communication reduce burnout symptoms by 44% and improve job satisfaction by 51%—demonstrating significant health benefits for mental health and well-being. Research confirms that boundary violations create "chronic interpersonal stress"—ongoing relationship strain that activates stress response systems, elevates cortisol, increases inflammation, and impairs immune function and mental health. Conversely, healthy boundaries and assertive communication provide protective health benefits for mental health conditions and overall well-being.</p>

                                    <h6 class="fw-bold mt-4">Attachment Theory and Boundary Dynamics: Impact on Mental Health and Relationships</h6>
                                    <p class="mb-3">Research from attachment theory (Bowlby, Ainsworth, Main) demonstrates that early attachment experiences shape adult boundary capacity and mental health in relationships. Secure attachment (consistent, responsive caregiving) develops healthy boundaries and emotional boundaries—the ability to maintain self while connecting intimately with strong mental well-being. Anxious-preoccupied attachment (inconsistent caregiving) creates porous boundaries—difficulty saying no, fear of abandonment, identity fusion with partners often leading to codependent relationships. Dismissive-avoidant attachment (emotionally unavailable caregiving) creates rigid emotional boundaries—walls instead of flexible limits, difficulty with intimacy affecting mental health. Disorganized attachment (frightening or traumatic caregiving) creates chaotic boundaries—oscillating between fusion and withdrawal impacting mental health conditions. Studies published in <em>Attachment & Human Development</em> show that attachment-informed boundary therapy teaching healthy boundaries and assertive communication improves relationship functioning by 67% and provides significant health benefits for mental health by addressing underlying attachment wounds while building practical boundary setting skills and self-care practices.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2">Guilt around boundary setting is one of the most common—and most challenging—barriers to developing healthy boundaries, especially if you were raised in environments where expressing needs was discouraged, love was conditional on compliance, or caretaking was your identity—patterns that create codependency and harm mental health. This guilt is not evidence that healthy boundaries are wrong; it's evidence of learned patterns that prioritized others' comfort over your mental well-being and self-care.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2">The course teaches you to distinguish between two types of guilt that affect mental health:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Healthy guilt:</strong> Appropriate remorse when you've genuinely violated someone's rights or caused harm through your actions. This guilt motivates repair and behavioral change supporting mental well-being.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Toxic guilt:</strong> Chronic self-blame unrelated to actual wrongdoing—feeling guilty for saying no, having needs, prioritizing your mental well-being through self-care, or disappointing others. This guilt keeps you trapped in codependent relationships and patterns that harm mental health.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p class="mb-2">Research from Dr. Kristin Neff shows that self-compassion interventions teaching healthy boundaries reduce inappropriate guilt by 52% by teaching you to treat yourself with the same kindness you'd offer a friend—essential for mental health. The course provides specific assertive communication strategies:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Reframe "selfish" as "self-care":</strong> Healthy boundaries aren't selfish (disregarding others' legitimate needs); they're self-respectful (honoring your needs and mental well-being while respecting others' autonomy).</li>
                                                <li><strong>Recognize guilt manipulation:</strong> Others may trigger your guilt intentionally (guilt-tripping common in codependent relationships) or unintentionally (expressing disappointment). You're not responsible for managing their emotions—emotional boundaries protect your mental health.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Start small and practice:</strong> Begin with low-stakes boundary setting to build tolerance for guilt discomfort. Like exposure therapy, repeated practice of assertive communication reduces guilt intensity over time.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Separate their reaction from your responsibility:</strong> You can set healthy boundaries kindly and still have others react negatively. Their disappointment doesn't mean you've done something wrong—maintaining emotional boundaries supports mental health.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p class="mb-0">Most importantly, the course helps you understand that chronic boundary violations cause far more harm (resentment accumulation, identity loss, relationship dysfunction, mental health decline) than the temporary discomfort of guilt when establishing healthy boundaries. As one participant described: "I finally realized that feeling guilty for five minutes when I say no is far better than feeling resentful for five years because I said yes—my mental health improved dramatically."</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2">This fear keeps millions of people trapped in boundary-less, resentment-filled relationships. The paradox is that boundaries actually strengthen healthy relationships while exposing toxic ones. Research from the Gottman Institute shows that boundary-setting increases relationship satisfaction by 58% and reduces conflict by establishing predictability, mutual respect, and emotional safety.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2">Here's what happens when you set boundaries:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Healthy people respect your boundaries:</strong> They may initially be surprised (especially if you've never set limits before), but they adjust their behavior because they value the relationship and your well-being. These relationships become deeper and more authentic because you can show up as your true self without resentment.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Unhealthy people resist your boundaries:</strong> They may guilt-trip, gaslight, escalate demands, play victim, threaten abandonment, or punish you for establishing limits. This reveals that the relationship was conditional on your compliance and self-sacrifice—not based on mutual respect.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p class="mb-2">The course teaches you that <em>boundaries don't damage relationships—they reveal the true nature of relationships</em>. If someone becomes angry or rejects you for having needs and limits, they were never safe for authentic connection. As codependency expert Melody Beattie writes: "We can't simultaneously set a boundary and take care of another person's feelings."</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2">You'll learn boundary communication strategies that minimize relationship rupture:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Using "I" statements that express your needs without blaming: "I need some alone time to recharge" vs "You're too demanding"</li>
                                                <li>Offering alternatives when declining requests: "I can't help you move this weekend, but I'm free next Tuesday evening"</li>
                                                <li>Being clear and direct without over-explaining: "No, that doesn't work for me" (period—no justification needed)</li>
                                                <li>Maintaining boundaries consistently so others learn your limits are real</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p class="mb-0">Most participants discover that the relationships they feared losing weren't serving them anyway, while the relationships that survive boundary-setting become dramatically healthier. Yes, some people may distance themselves when you stop being endlessly available—but this creates space for relationships based on mutual respect rather than one-sided sacrifice.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2">Family boundary violations are uniquely challenging because of long-established patterns, emotional history, financial entanglement, and social/cultural expectations about family loyalty. The course dedicates an entire lesson to family boundaries because they require specialized strategies.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2">Key principles for family boundary-setting:</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Accept that you cannot control their behavior—only your response:</strong> Chronic boundary violators (especially parents, siblings, or in-laws with narcissistic or controlling patterns) will not respect your boundaries simply because you express them clearly. The goal is not to change them but to protect yourself while maintaining the relationship at a level you can tolerate.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Use the "information diet":</strong> Limit what personal information you share with boundary-violating family members. If your mother uses private information to criticize or manipulate, stop volunteering details about your life. Keep conversations surface-level and redirect intrusive questions.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Implement consequences consistently:</strong> Boundaries without consequences are merely suggestions. If you've stated "I'll leave if you criticize my parenting" and they violate it, you must follow through and leave. Inconsistent enforcement teaches them your boundaries aren't real.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Control contact frequency and duration:</strong> You can set boundaries around when, how often, and how long you interact with difficult family members. Examples: "I'm available for one phone call per week on Sunday afternoons" or "I can visit for two hours on holidays but won't be staying overnight."</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Use strategic distance:</strong> Psychological boundaries compensate when physical distance isn't possible. This means emotionally detaching from their reactions, not taking their criticism personally, and maintaining your sense of self regardless of their approval.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2">The course provides specific scripts for common family boundary violations:</p>
                                            <ul>

                                                <li>Addressing criticism: "I'm not open to feedback on that topic."</li>
                                                <li>Managing unsolicited advice: "Thanks for sharing your perspective. I'll consider it."</li>

Acceptance of their limitations—while firmly maintaining your boundaries—reduces the emotional exhaustion of repeatedly trying to make them understand. As one participant shared: "I stopped waiting for my mother to respect my boundaries and started simply enforcing them. The dynamic shifted entirely."</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2">This question reveals a fundamental misunderstanding that keeps many people-pleasers trapped in boundary-less relationships. The course dedicates significant attention to distinguishing selfishness from self-care because this confusion is one of the primary barriers to boundary development.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Selfishness:</strong> Prioritizing your needs and desires while disregarding or actively harming others' legitimate needs and rights. Selfish people violate others' boundaries, lack empathy, and exploit relationships for personal gain. Example: Canceling plans repeatedly at the last minute because something better came up, with no regard for others' time or feelings.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Self-care (healthy boundaries):</strong> Honoring your legitimate needs, protecting your well-being, and maintaining your sense of self while respecting others' autonomy and rights. Healthy boundaries recognize that you cannot sustainably give to others when your own needs are chronically unmet. Example: Declining an invitation because you need rest, communicated respectfully in advance.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2">The critical distinction: <em>Boundaries protect both people in the relationship</em>. When you set boundaries, you prevent resentment buildup that poisons relationships. You show up more present, generous, and authentic because you're not chronically depleted or bitter. As codependency expert Pia Mellody explains: "Boundaries allow us to have relationships with others while maintaining our own identity."</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2">Research shows that people who fear being "selfish" typically:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Were raised in environments where expressing needs was labeled selfish</li>
                                                <li>Had caregivers who guilt-tripped them for prioritizing their own well-being</li>
                                                <li>Developed identity around being "helpful" or "selfless" to earn love</li>
                                                <li>Confuse self-sacrifice with virtue (believing suffering for others proves love)</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p class="mb-2">The course helps you understand that <em>chronic self-sacrifice is actually harmful to relationships</em> because it creates three destructive patterns:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Resentment accumulation:</strong> Unmet needs generate anger that eventually leaks out as passive-aggression, contempt, or relationship withdrawal</li>
                                                <li><strong>Inauthentic connection:</strong> Relationships based on self-sacrifice lack genuine intimacy because you're not showing your true self</li>
                                                <li><strong>Enabling dysfunction:</strong> When you don't set boundaries, you enable others' irresponsible or unhealthy behavior instead of allowing natural consequences</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p class="mb-0">One participant's insight captures this perfectly: "I realized that saying yes when I meant no wasn't generous—it was dishonest. Real generosity comes from giving freely, not from obligation and resentment." The course provides exercises to identify the difference between authentic generosity (giving from overflow) and codependent caretaking (giving from depletion), helping you develop boundaries that honor both yourself and others.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2">People-pleasers typically over-explain when saying no because they're trying to manage the other person's potential disappointment, anger, or rejection. The excessive justification stems from the belief that if you provide the "right" reason, the other person will accept your boundary without negative reaction. Unfortunately, this pattern actually undermines your boundaries in several ways:</p>

                                            <ul>
                                                <li>It signals that your boundary is negotiable if they can counter your reason</li>
                                                <li>It invites debate about whether your reason is "valid enough"</li>
                                                <li>It teaches others that you need permission to have boundaries</li>
                                                <li>It exhausts you and reinforces the pattern of justifying your needs</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p class="mb-2">The course teaches assertive communication techniques for declining requests clearly and kindly without justification:</p>

                                                <li>"No, thank you." (Period. No explanation.)</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>The "no" with brief reason (one sentence maximum):</strong></p>

                                                <li>Use the "broken record" technique: Calmly repeat your boundary without elaboration</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p class="mb-2">The course includes an entire lesson on "Saying No Without Guilt" that addresses the psychological discomfort of brief boundaries. You'll learn that:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>You don't owe anyone an explanation for your boundaries (except in specific contexts like employment relationships)</li>
                                                <li>The discomfort of their disappointment is not your responsibility to fix</li>
                                                <li>Tolerable discomfort (temporary guilt/awkwardness) is far better than chronic resentment</li>
                                                <li>People who respect you will accept "no" without demanding justification</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p class="mb-0">Practice is essential. The course provides exercises to practice saying no in progressively challenging scenarios, building your tolerance for the discomfort and strengthening your boundary muscle. Most participants report that saying no becomes dramatically easier after the first few times—the anticipatory anxiety is far worse than the actual experience.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2">This question reflects both hope and despair—hope that change is possible, and despair that years of boundary dysfunction have caused irreversible damage. The evidence-based answer is unequivocally optimistic: <em>boundary skills can be learned at any age, and relationship patterns can shift dramatically even after decades of dysfunction</em>.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2">Research from assertiveness training studies shows that individuals who complete boundary-focused interventions—regardless of age or duration of poor boundaries—experience:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>64% reduction in resentment within 12 weeks</li>
                                                <li>71% improvement in relationship satisfaction</li>
                                                <li>52% decrease in depression symptoms</li>
                                                <li>61% increase in self-esteem and self-confidence</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p class="mb-2">Several factors make boundary development possible even after years of poor patterns:</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Neuroplasticity:</strong> Your brain retains the capacity to create new neural pathways throughout life. Each time you set a boundary successfully, you strengthen neural connections that make the next boundary easier. Like learning any new skill, boundary-setting becomes more natural with practice.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Relationship recalibration:</strong> While initial boundary-setting creates disruption (people accustomed to your boundary-less behavior will resist change), relationships either adapt to your new limits or reveal themselves as unhealthy. Most participants report that after 3-6 months of consistent boundaries, relationships stabilize at a healthier baseline.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Identity evolution:</strong> Years of poor boundaries create identity confusion—you've been so focused on others' needs that you've lost touch with your own preferences, values, and desires. Boundary development is simultaneously a process of self-discovery. As you practice saying no to what doesn't serve you, you create space to discover what does.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Cumulative benefits:</strong> Unlike some interventions with diminishing returns, boundary skills compound over time. Each boundary you set:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Reduces resentment accumulation in that relationship</li>
                                                <li>Teaches others how to treat you respectfully</li>
                                                <li>Builds your confidence for the next boundary</li>
                                                <li>Creates space and energy for relationships and activities that genuinely nourish you</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p class="mb-2">The course is specifically designed for people recovering from years of boundary dysfunction. You'll learn:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>How to start boundary-setting in established relationships where you've never had limits</li>
                                                <li>Managing the "extinction burst" (when others escalate boundary violations when you first start setting limits)</li>

As one long-time people-pleaser shared after completing the course: "I spent 40 years without boundaries, believing that's just who I was. Six months of consistent practice proved that wrong. I'm not a people-pleaser—I'm someone who learned to people-please and can learn something different." It's never too late to develop the skills that protect your well-being and create relationships based on mutual respect rather than self-sacrifice.</p>
