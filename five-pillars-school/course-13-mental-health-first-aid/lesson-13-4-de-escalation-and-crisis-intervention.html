                        <h3>🌊 Understanding the Framework</h3>
                        <p>This section explores evidence-based principles, research foundations, and practical applications:</p>

                        <div class="brain-systems">
                            <div class="system-item">
                                <h4>💙 Foundation Principle #1: Evidence-Based Practice</h4>
                                <p><strong>Research basis:</strong> Effective mental health first aid integrates findings from crisis intervention research, peer support outcomes, trauma-informed care studies, and community mental health program evaluation demonstrating measurable positive impacts.</p>
                                <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> MHFA works because it's grounded in understanding of how people experience and recover from mental health challenges, not just theoretical knowledge.</p>
                                <p><strong>Practical application:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Use validated assessment tools and intervention frameworks proven effective across diverse populations</li>
                                    <li>Recognize that evidence-based doesn't mean rigid—adapt approaches to individual and cultural context</li>
                                    <li>Stay current with evolving research while honoring traditional healing practices and community wisdom</li>
                                    <li>Document outcomes to contribute to practice-based evidence building community knowledge</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>MHFA distinction:</strong> Community supporters using evidence-based approaches achieve outcomes comparable to professional interventions for appropriate support levels.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="system-item">
                                <h4>🌟 Foundation Principle #2: ALGEE Framework Application</h4>
                                <p><strong>Systematic approach:</strong> The ALGEE framework provides structured yet flexible guidance for mental health support:</p>
                                <p><strong>A - Assess for risk of suicide or harm:</strong> Safety always comes first. Direct, compassionate inquiry saves lives.</p>
                                <p><strong>L - Listen nonjudgmentally:</strong> Therapeutic listening validates experience, reduces isolation, and builds trust essential for help-seeking.</p>
                                <p><strong>G - Give reassurance and information:</strong> Accurate information combats stigma and provides hope while setting realistic expectations.</p>
                                <p><strong>E - Encourage appropriate professional help:</strong> Know when and how to connect with higher levels of care.</p>
                                <p><strong>E - Encourage self-help and other support:</strong> Empower individuals to activate their own resources and support networks.</p>
                                <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> ALGEE addresses both immediate safety and long-term recovery, balancing crisis response with ongoing support facilitation.</p>

                            <div class="system-item">
                                <h4>🧠 Foundation Principle #3: Trauma-Informed Approach</h4>
                                <p><strong>Universal precaution:</strong> Assume trauma history and create safety without requiring disclosure or re-traumatization.</p>
                                <p><strong>Six trauma-informed principles guide all MHFA:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Create physical and psychological safety in every interaction</li>
                                    <li><strong>Trustworthiness:</strong> Demonstrate reliability, consistency, and appropriate boundaries</li>
                                    <li><strong>Peer support:</strong> Recognize healing power of shared experience and mutual aid</li>
                                    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Partner with individuals rather than directing their recovery</li>
                                    <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Support choice, voice, and self-determination in help-seeking</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cultural, historical, gender issues:</strong> Acknowledge how identity and oppression affect mental health</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Trauma-informed approaches increase engagement by 40-60% while preventing re-traumatization that can occur through well-meaning but uninformed support.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h4>💪 Foundation Principle #4: Ethical Boundaries</h4>
                                <p><strong>Scope of practice clarity:</strong> MHFA provides initial support and connection to resources, not ongoing therapy or professional treatment.</p>
                                <p><strong>Core ethical principles:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Beneficence:</strong> Act to benefit others while recognizing limitations of training and role</li>
                                    <li><strong>Non-maleficence:</strong> First, do no harm—recognize when support attempts might cause damage</li>
                                    <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> Respect individual choice even when you disagree with decisions</li>
                                    <li><strong>Justice:</strong> Provide equitable support regardless of characteristics or circumstances</li>
                                    <li><strong>Fidelity:</strong> Honor commitments, maintain confidentiality with appropriate exceptions</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Boundary challenges:</strong> Helper burnout, dual relationships, over-involvement, and rescue fantasies require ongoing attention and supervision.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h4>🌈 Foundation Principle #5: Cultural Humility</h4>
                                <p><strong>Beyond cultural competence:</strong> Approach each person as unique teacher about their own cultural experience and healing traditions.</p>
                                <p><strong>Cultural humility practices:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Recognize your own cultural lens affects perception of "normal" vs "pathological"</li>
                                    <li>Ask about individual beliefs, practices, and preferences rather than assuming based on group identity</li>
                                    <li>Acknowledge power differences and work to minimize negative impacts on helping relationship</li>
                                    <li>Learn continuously from communities you serve—cultural understanding is lifelong journey</li>
                                    <li>Adapt evidence-based practices to align with cultural values while maintaining core effectiveness</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Research validation:</strong> Culturally adapted interventions show 20-40% greater effectiveness than standard approaches across diverse populations.</p>

                        <p><strong>ALGEE Framework:</strong> The 5-step ALGEE model provides systematic structure for effective mental health support: Assess, Listen, Give info, Encourage professional help, Encourage self-help.</p>

                        <p><strong>Evidence-Based Practice:</strong> MHFA works because it's grounded in research showing community supporters can significantly reduce untreated mental illness duration and prevent crisis escalation.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p><strong>Trauma-Informed Approach:</strong> Always assume possible trauma history and create safety through trustworthiness, collaboration, empowerment, and cultural responsiveness.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="takeaway-item">
                        <span class="takeaway-icon">⚖️</span>
                        <p><strong>Ethical Boundaries:</strong> MHFA provides initial support and resource connection, not ongoing therapy. Know your scope and limitations to help effectively and sustainably.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="takeaway-item">
                        <span class="takeaway-icon">🌍</span>
                        <p><strong>Cultural Humility:</strong> Approach each person as unique teacher about their experience. Cultural adaptation increases intervention effectiveness by 20-40%.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="takeaway-item">
                        <span class="takeaway-icon">💚</span>
                        <p><strong>Self-Care Imperative:</strong> Prevent secondary trauma and burnout through systematic self-care. Effective helpers take care of themselves to sustain their ability to help others.</p>
