                            <h3 class="h5 fw-bold text-primary mb-3">Why Workplace Mental Health Matters: Understanding the Workplace Burnout Epidemic and Mental Health Conditions</h3>
                            <p class="mb-3">The modern workplace mental health crisis has reached epidemic proportions, with profound consequences for employee well-being and organizational performance. The World Health Organization's landmark 2019 decision to classify workplace burnout as an "occupational phenomenon" in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) represented official recognition that work environments directly cause mental health deterioration and contribute to various mental health conditions. Current data reveals the staggering scope: 76% of American employees report that workplace stress negatively impacts their mental health, 28% describe their workplace as "mentally unhealthy," and 77% of workers experience burnout in their current job. The economic toll is equally devastating—workplace stress costs U.S. employers $300 billion annually in absenteeism, turnover, reduced productivity, and healthcare expenses. More critically, chronic workplace stress increases risk of clinical depression by 280%, anxiety disorders by 340%, and cardiovascular disease by 40-50%, highlighting the urgent need for mental health treatment and occupational health interventions.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">The biological mechanisms underlying work-related mental health decline are well-documented. Chronic workplace stress triggers sustained activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to persistently elevated cortisol levels that damage the hippocampus (memory and emotion regulation), prefrontal cortex (executive function and decision-making), and immune system. The Job Demand-Control-Support model, validated across hundreds of studies, demonstrates that high job demands combined with low control and inadequate social support creates a toxic triad that predictably produces workplace burnout, characterized by emotional exhaustion (feeling drained and depleted), depersonalization/cynicism (detachment from work and colleagues), and reduced personal accomplishment (decreased sense of competence and achievement). Unlike temporary stress or fatigue, burnout represents a chronic state of dysregulation requiring systematic mental health treatment—simply taking a vacation or "practicing self-care" proves insufficient without addressing underlying workplace factors and mental health conditions.</p>

                            <h3 class="h5 fw-bold text-primary mb-3 mt-4">What You'll Master: Evidence-Based Mental Health Treatment for Workplace Burnout and Employee Mental Health</h3>
                            <p class="mb-3">This evidence-based workplace mental health course provides comprehensive strategies for recognizing, treating, and preventing occupational burnout while building sustainable employee well-being. You'll learn to identify the three dimensions of burnout using validated assessment tools, distinguish healthy workplace challenge (eustress that promotes growth) from harmful workplace stress (distress that causes deterioration and mental health conditions), and recognize early warning signs before reaching crisis. The course teaches practical implementation of occupational health models to modify your work environment, including negotiating for increased autonomy, restructuring job demands, and building workplace social support networks. You'll master psychological safety principles drawn from Google's Project Aristotle research (a multi-year study identifying team effectiveness factors) and Amy Edmondson's Harvard research, learning to create psychologically safe environments where people feel safe to speak up, take risks, admit mistakes, and ask for help without fear of punishment or humiliation—a cornerstone of employee mental health.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">Professional boundary setting receives extensive attention, with modules teaching assertive communication frameworks (distinguishing assertive, passive, and aggressive communication styles), scripts for difficult workplace conversations, strategies for managing demanding supervisors while protecting your mental health, techniques for handling unreasonable workload expectations and workplace stress, and methods for creating sustainable work-life integration that support employee well-being (replacing the outdated concept of "balance"). You'll learn evidence-based workplace stress management specifically adapted for workplace contexts, including cortisol regulation techniques, cognitive restructuring for work-related thought patterns, conflict resolution strategies, and organizational change navigation. The course addresses toxic workplace dynamics with practical survival strategies for maintaining workplace mental health, recognizing when to attempt change versus when leaving is the healthiest choice, documentation practices for protecting yourself, and maintaining mental health during job transitions—all key health benefits of this comprehensive mental health treatment program.</p>

                            <p class="mb-4">Created by board-certified psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner David Glenn, PMHNP-BC, with over 14 years of clinical experience treating work-related mental health conditions including occupational burnout, workplace-induced depression and anxiety, compassion fatigue in healthcare workers, and career-related existential distress, this course translates organizational psychology research and psychiatric mental health treatment approaches into immediately actionable strategies for employee mental health. Whether you're an employee experiencing burnout or chronic workplace stress, a manager seeking to support team mental health and build psychologically safe environments, an HR professional developing workplace wellness initiatives focused on employee well-being and occupational health, an entrepreneur managing business-related stress, or a career changer navigating transitions, this course provides the scientific foundation and practical tools to create sustainable career well-being and organizational mental health through evidence-based mental health treatment.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-3">The World Health Organization's inclusion of workplace burnout in the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) represents landmark official recognition that work environments cause mental health deterioration and contribute to mental health conditions. Burnout is defined as "a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed," characterized by three dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization/cynicism, and reduced personal accomplishment. This classification validates decades of occupational health research demonstrating workplace factors as direct causes of mental health conditions, not merely individual weakness or poor stress management, emphasizing the need for mental health treatment approaches focused on employee well-being.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-3">Validated across hundreds of international studies involving tens of thousands of workers, this foundational occupational health psychology model demonstrates that workplace stress and mental health conditions result from the interaction of three factors: high psychological job demands (workload, time pressure, conflicting demands), low decision latitude/job control (autonomy, skill discretion, decision authority), and inadequate workplace social support. The "iso-strain" condition (high demands + low control + low support) predicts cardiovascular disease, clinical depression, anxiety disorders, and all-cause mortality. Meta-analyses confirm that modifying these workplace factors significantly reduces burnout and improves mental health outcomes and employee well-being, demonstrating clear health benefits of occupational health interventions.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-3">Dr. Christina Maslach's 40+ years of workplace burnout research at UC Berkeley established the three-dimensional model of burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, reduced personal efficacy) and developed the most widely used burnout assessment tool for evaluating mental health conditions related to workplace stress. Studies using the MBI across healthcare, education, corporate, and service sectors consistently identify six organizational risk factors impacting employee mental health: workload (excessive quantity/complexity), control (insufficient autonomy), reward (inadequate recognition), community (lack of social support/conflict), fairness (inequitable treatment), and values (ethical conflicts). Mental health treatment interventions addressing these workplace factors show significant burnout reduction, improved job satisfaction, and enhanced employee well-being with measurable health benefits.</p>

                                    <h6 class="fw-bold mt-4">Google's Project Aristotle: Psychological Safety Research for Employee Mental Health</h6>
                                    <p class="mb-3">Google's multi-year study analyzing 180+ teams found psychological safety as the single most important factor predicting team effectiveness and workplace mental health—more than individual talent, team composition, or workload. Psychological safety, defined by Harvard professor Amy Edmondson, means "a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking." Teams with high psychological safety demonstrate better problem-solving, more innovation, higher performance, and significantly better employee well-being. Research shows psychological safety reduces workplace anxiety and mental health conditions, increases engagement, and buffers against burnout effects, providing substantial health benefits for employee mental health in organizational settings.</p>

                                    <h6 class="fw-bold mt-4">Work-Life Balance Intervention Studies - Mental Health Treatment for Workplace Stress</h6>
                                    <p class="mb-3">Systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in <em>Journal of Occupational Health Psychology</em> and <em>The Lancet</em> examine workplace interventions for mental health and employee well-being. Results show that organizational-level changes (flexible work arrangements, reduced overtime expectations, supervisor training in supportive management) produce larger effect sizes for mental health improvement than individual-focused interventions alone, demonstrating significant health benefits. The "work-life integration" framework proves more effective than "work-life balance" for modern work contexts, acknowledging permeable boundaries while emphasizing intentional priority alignment and sustainable workload management that supports workplace mental health and prevents burnout.</p>

                                    <h6 class="fw-bold mt-4">Workplace Stress and Health Outcomes Research - Occupational Health Evidence</h6>
                                    <p class="mb-3">Longitudinal studies published in <em>JAMA</em>, <em>BMJ</em>, and <em>Occupational and Environmental Medicine</em> demonstrate clear causal relationships between chronic workplace stress and serious mental health conditions and health outcomes. The Whitehall II study (following 10,000+ British civil servants for 30+ years) found that job strain increased coronary heart disease risk by 50%, with workplace stress effects mediated by HPA axis dysregulation and chronic cortisol elevation. Additional occupational health research links workplace stress to increased risk of type 2 diabetes (45% higher risk), stroke (33% higher), and autoimmune conditions, beyond mental health impacts, emphasizing the critical need for mental health treatment and burnout prevention programs focused on employee well-being.</p>

                                    <h6 class="fw-bold mt-4">Organizational Mental Health Meta-Analyses - Evidence for Employee Well-Being Programs</h6>
                                    <p class="mb-3">Comprehensive meta-analyses in <em>Psychological Bulletin</em> and <em>Work & Stress</em> examining workplace mental health interventions and employee mental health programs find that multi-level approaches (combining organizational change, leadership training, and individual skill development) produce the strongest outcomes for employee well-being. Programs integrating workplace stress management training, cognitive-behavioral mental health treatment approaches, mindfulness-based interventions, and organizational policy changes show effect sizes of 0.40-0.68 for reducing anxiety and depression symptoms and preventing workplace burnout. Cost-benefit analyses consistently demonstrate ROI of $4-6 returned for every dollar invested in comprehensive workplace mental health programs through reduced absenteeism, turnover, and healthcare costs, with significant health benefits for employee mental health and organizational occupational health metrics.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2">This is one of the most important distinctions for workplace mental health and employee well-being. Normal workplace stress is temporary, responds to rest and recovery, and often includes feelings of engagement despite pressure. Workplace burnout represents chronic dysregulation with three distinct dimensions that require mental health treatment:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Emotional exhaustion:</strong> Feeling completely drained, depleted, and unable to recover even after rest. You wake up tired despite adequate sleep, dread going to work, and feel like you have nothing left to give. This goes beyond typical tiredness—it's a pervasive sense of depletion affecting all areas of life.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Depersonalization/cynicism:</strong> Developing negative, detached, or callous attitudes toward work, colleagues, or clients/customers. You find yourself being sarcastic, dismissive, or emotionally distant in professional relationships. You stop caring about things that used to matter and feel disconnected from your work's meaning.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Reduced personal accomplishment:</strong> Feeling incompetent, ineffective, or like your work doesn't matter despite objective evidence of your contributions. Your self-confidence erodes, you doubt your abilities, and you question whether you're making any meaningful impact.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p class="mb-2">Key differences from normal workplace stress:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Workplace stress is episodic; burnout is chronic and persistent over months, requiring mental health treatment</li>
                                                <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Stress improves with rest; burnout doesn't resolve with vacation alone and may indicate mental health conditions</li>
                                                <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Stress can coexist with motivation; burnout includes apathy and cynicism affecting employee well-being</li>
                                                <li><strong>Physical symptoms:</strong> Burnout often includes persistent headaches, gastrointestinal issues, muscle tension, frequent illness from immune suppression, and sleep disturbances that don't improve with typical interventions—health consequences requiring occupational health attention</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p class="mb-0">This workplace mental health course teaches you to use validated assessment tools like the Maslach Burnout Inventory to objectively measure your burnout levels, identify which dimensions are most affected, recognize early warning signs before reaching crisis, and implement evidence-based mental health treatment interventions targeting the specific causes of your workplace stress. Early recognition and mental health treatment dramatically improve recovery outcomes and employee well-being, with significant health benefits for long-term workplace mental health.</p>

                                                <li><strong>Passive:</strong> Saying yes to everything, avoiding conflict, suppressing your needs (leads to resentment, burnout, and decreased respect)</li>
                                                <li><strong>Aggressive:</strong> Demanding, confrontational, dismissive of others' needs (damages relationships and reputation)</li>
                                                <li><strong>Assertive:</strong> Clearly expressing your limits while respecting others, offering alternatives, using collaborative problem-solving (maintains relationships while protecting wellbeing)</li>

                                                <li><strong>Clarify priorities collaboratively:</strong> "I want to ensure I'm focusing on the highest-priority projects. Given my current workload of X, Y, and Z, which should take precedence if I take on this new task? What can be delayed or delegated?"</li>
                                                <li><strong>Use objective data:</strong> "I'm currently at 45 hours of committed work this week. Research shows productivity significantly declines beyond 50 hours, and I want to maintain the quality you expect. Can we discuss timeline adjustments or additional resources?"</li>
                                                <li><strong>Offer solutions, not just problems:</strong> "I can't stay late tonight, but I can come in early tomorrow" or "I can't take on this full project, but I can handle X component if you can find support for Y and Z."</li>
                                                <li><strong>Set communication boundaries:</strong> "I check email until 6pm on weekdays and once on Sunday evenings. For urgent matters outside those times, please call me directly so I know it requires immediate attention."</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p class="mb-2">Document the pattern (dates, specific requests, impacts on your work quality/health and employee well-being), discuss with HR if your manager's demands violate company policies and affect workplace mental health, and recognize that some workplace cultures are fundamentally incompatible with healthy boundaries and psychological safety—this isn't your failure, it's an organizational problem affecting mental health. The workplace mental health course includes detailed scripts for these difficult conversations, guidance on when to escalate to HR, strategies for protecting your mental health in toxic environments, and frameworks for deciding when leaving is the healthiest choice for your employee well-being.</p>
                                            <p class="mb-0">Research shows that assertive boundary-setting, while initially uncomfortable, actually increases respect and effectiveness over time, with health benefits for both workplace mental health and occupational health. Managers generally respect employees who clearly communicate limits while offering solutions, as it prevents surprises and demonstrates professional maturity that supports psychological safety.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-0">The workplace mental health course includes a comprehensive decision-making framework for evaluating whether to stay or leave, strategies for conducting a job search while employed, mental health treatment and protection during toxic workplace exposure and burnout, and how to process the grief, anger, and self-doubt that often accompany leaving a toxic job. Remember: Choosing to leave isn't failure—it's recognizing that some environments are fundamentally incompatible with human well-being and employee mental health, and your mental health matters more than any job. Prioritizing workplace mental health and seeking mental health treatment when needed are signs of strength, with lasting health benefits for your overall well-being.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2">First, let's reframe the question. Research increasingly suggests that "work-life balance"—the idea of perfectly equal time/energy allocation—is an unrealistic and unhelpful goal for modern careers and workplace mental health. The more useful framework is "work-life integration": intentionally aligning your work with your values, managing energy (not just time), and creating sustainable patterns that protect what matters most for employee well-being and prevent workplace burnout.</p>
                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Evidence-based strategies for sustainable high-demand careers and workplace mental health:</strong></p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Differentiate between busy seasons and chronic overwork causing burnout:</strong> Sustainable careers supporting workplace mental health have periods of intensity followed by recovery. Unsustainable careers maintain constant workplace stress indefinitely. The former supports employee well-being; the latter guarantees workplace burnout and mental health conditions.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Protect non-negotiables for mental health:</strong> Identify 2-3 priorities outside work that are essential to your well-being (family dinner, exercise, sleep, spiritual practice, friendships) and treat these as immovable appointments supporting your mental health, not "if I have time" activities.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Use time-blocking and communication boundaries for psychological safety:</strong> Establish when you're available and when you're not. Research shows that unpredictable workplace stress (never knowing when work will intrude) is more harmful to employee mental health than long hours with clear boundaries.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Practice strategic incompleteness:</strong> Accept that in high-demand roles, something will always be undone. The skill supporting workplace mental health is choosing what to leave undone based on actual priorities, not trying to do everything (which leads to workplace burnout).</li>
                                                <li><strong>Manage energy, not just time, for occupational health:</strong> High-performers protect sleep, exercise, nutrition, and recovery as performance necessities supporting employee well-being, not luxuries. Research consistently shows that working while depleted produces poor-quality work and takes longer than working while well-rested, with health benefits from proper recovery.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>When "balance" becomes impossible and workplace stress threatens mental health:</strong></p>
                                            <p class="mb-2">Some careers and companies demand levels of commitment fundamentally incompatible with other important life domains and workplace mental health. This isn't your failure to "balance"—it's a structural reality requiring honest evaluation: Is this career/company worth the tradeoffs to your mental health and employee well-being? Are these tradeoffs temporary or permanent? What are you gaining and losing by staying?</p>
                                            <p class="mb-0">The workplace mental health course teaches detailed implementation of work-life integration strategies supporting employee well-being, including time-blocking systems, communication scripts for setting boundaries that protect mental health, energy management principles for occupational health, values clarification exercises to identify your true priorities, and decision frameworks for career changes when a role proves fundamentally unsustainable and threatens workplace mental health. Many high-achieving professionals find sustainable fulfillment with lasting health benefits when they stop trying to "do it all" and start intentionally choosing what matters most for their mental health.</p>

                                            <p class="mb-2">Leaving a job for mental health reasons is one of the most significant—and often agonizing—career decisions affecting workplace mental health and employee well-being. Research on occupational health, mental health treatment, quality of life, and life satisfaction provides some guidance for this deeply personal decision about workplace mental health:</p>
                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Clear indicators that leaving is likely necessary for your mental health:</strong></p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Severe mental health deterioration:</strong> Development of mental health conditions including clinical depression, anxiety disorder, panic attacks, workplace burnout, or suicidal ideation directly related to workplace stress. If you require mental health treatment specifically because of your job, this is a critical warning sign requiring immediate attention to employee well-being.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Physical health impacts:</strong> Stress-induced physical illness (cardiovascular problems, gastrointestinal disorders, autoimmune flares, chronic pain), substance use to cope with work stress, or sleep disorders that persist despite intervention.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Diminished functioning across life domains:</strong> When work stress so dominates your mental space that relationships suffer, parenting suffers, self-care becomes impossible, and you have no energy for anything besides work and recovery from work.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Values/ethics conflicts:</strong> Being required to act against your core values or ethical principles regularly, especially if the conflict causes moral injury (psychological distress from transgressing deeply held moral beliefs).</li>
                                                <li><strong>Fundamental incompatibility:</strong> After honest effort to improve the situation (attempting boundary-setting, addressing concerns, seeking internal transfers), nothing changes and you recognize the culture or role is fundamentally incompatible with wellbeing.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Framework for decision-making:</strong></p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Assess controllability:</strong> Are the problems within your sphere of influence (your response, boundaries, role negotiation) or outside it (toxic leadership, systemic dysfunction, unethical company practices)? Focus energy where you have control.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Define "success" and "enough":</strong> What would a tolerable version of this job look like? Is that version achievable? If not, you have valuable information.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Consider the counterfactual:</strong> If you stay, what's the likely outcome in 1 year, 3 years, 5 years? If you leave, what's the worst-case scenario and can you handle it?</li>
                                                <li><strong>Consult trusted advisors:</strong> Talk to mentors, therapists, or trusted colleagues who know both you and your industry. They can often see patterns you're too close to recognize.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Prepare financially and logistically:</strong> If possible, build savings, research job market, update resume, activate network before leaving. Financial stress compounds mental health challenges during transitions.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Important considerations:</strong></p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Some jobs are worth leaving without another position lined up—your health and safety matter more than employment continuity</li>
                                                <li>Leaving a toxic job isn't giving up or weakness; it's recognizing that some environments are incompatible with human wellbeing</li>
                                                <li>Career changes often feel terrifying but frequently lead to better long-term outcomes when the previous role was causing significant harm</li>
                                                <li>Process the grief, anger, and self-doubt that accompany leaving—these feelings are normal and don't mean you made the wrong decision</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p class="mb-0">The workplace mental health course includes comprehensive decision-making tools for career transitions affecting employee well-being, mental health treatment and protection strategies during job searches, financial planning for career changes, and frameworks for processing the complex emotions that accompany leaving a job for mental health reasons. This is one of the most difficult workplace mental health decisions you'll face—having structured support through the process makes an enormous difference with lasting health benefits for your overall mental health and well-being.</p>

Research on workplace disclosure, occupational health, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) provides important guidance:</p>
                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Legal protections (in the United States):</strong></p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>The ADA prohibits discrimination based on mental health conditions and requires employers to provide "reasonable accommodations" for qualified individuals with disabilities</li>
                                                <li>You must have a diagnosed mental health condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities to qualify for ADA protections</li>
                                                <li>Accommodations might include flexible schedule, remote work options, modified job duties, time off for treatment, or quiet workspace</li>
                                                <li>You're not required to disclose your specific diagnosis—you can request accommodations based on functional limitations without detailed disclosure</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Strategic disclosure framework for workplace mental health:</strong></p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Assess organizational culture and psychological safety first:</strong> Does your workplace demonstrate workplace mental health awareness and support for employee well-being? Have others disclosed mental health conditions successfully? Is leadership supportive of employee mental health or stigmatizing?</li>
                                                <li><strong>Determine what you need for your mental health:</strong> Be specific about accommodations before disclosing. "I need mental health support" is vague; "I need to adjust my start time to 9:30am to attend weekly mental health treatment" is actionable and supports employee well-being.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Choose your audience carefully for psychological safety:</strong> HR is typically the appropriate first contact for workplace mental health accommodation requests. Your direct manager may or may not be supportive of mental health needs—use judgment based on your relationship and the psychological safety of your workplace.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Control the narrative around mental health:</strong> Frame disclosure around functional needs and solutions supporting employee well-being, not just problems. "I manage an anxiety disorder and would benefit from working remotely 2 days per week to reduce commute stress and workplace stress. This accommodation would help me maintain my productivity and support my mental health treatment."</li>
                                                <li><strong>Document everything related to mental health disclosure:</strong> Keep written records of workplace mental health accommodation requests, approvals, and any concerning responses. This protects you legally if discrimination based on mental health conditions occurs.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Disclosure scripts (examples from course):</strong></p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Minimal disclosure:</strong> "I have a medical condition that occasionally requires treatment appointments. I'd like to adjust my schedule to accommodate these appointments. Can we discuss flexible arrangements?"</li>
                                                <li><strong>Moderate disclosure:</strong> "I'm managing a mental health condition that affects my energy levels. I'm working with my healthcare provider and would benefit from [specific accommodation]. This would help me maintain my performance while managing my health."</li>
                                                <li><strong>Full disclosure (only when organizational culture supports):</strong> "I want to be transparent about my situation. I have depression and it sometimes affects my concentration. I'm in treatment and doing well, but I'd like to discuss accommodations like [specifics] that would help me continue performing at my best."</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p class="mb-2">Despite legal protections, workplace mental health stigma and discrimination persist. If your workplace has demonstrated hostility toward mental health, values "toughness" over employee well-being, lacks psychological safety, lacks HR support, or has retaliated against others who disclosed mental health conditions, you may need to protect yourself by limiting disclosure. This isn't dishonesty—it's recognizing that not all environments are psychologically safe for vulnerability about mental health.</p>
                                            <p class="mb-0">The workplace mental health course provides detailed guidance on assessing organizational culture and psychological safety, legal rights and protections for mental health conditions, accommodation negotiation strategies supporting employee well-being, discrimination documentation, scripts for various disclosure scenarios about mental health, and alternative approaches when disclosure feels unsafe. Your mental health and career both matter—strategic disclosure helps protect both when done thoughtfully, with health benefits for long-term workplace mental health and employee well-being.</p>
