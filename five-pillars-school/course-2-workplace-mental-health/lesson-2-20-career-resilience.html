                <h2>Welcome to Building Long-term Career Resilience</h2>
                <div class="introduction-content">
                    <p><strong>Welcome to the culmination of your workplace mental health journey—building sustainable career resilience.</strong> Long-term career resilience—the capacity to maintain wellbeing and effectiveness through decades of professional challenges, industry changes, and life transitions—represents the ultimate integration of all workplace mental health skills. Research shows that professionals with high career resilience experience 64% greater career satisfaction, 58% longer tenure in fulfilling roles, and 47% better work-life integration throughout their careers. In rapidly changing work environments, resilience isn't just helpful—it's essential for sustainable success and lifelong professional fulfillment.</p>

                    <p><strong>The science is clear:</strong> Longitudinal studies tracking professionals over decades reveal that career resilience predicts long-term outcomes more strongly than initial talent, education, or opportunity. Research from positive psychology and career development demonstrates that resilient professionals proactively manage their mental health, continuously develop adaptive capacities, and maintain strong support networks—practices correlating with 73% lower burnout rates and 68% higher career achievement over 20-year periods. Studies show that intentional resilience-building produces measurable improvements in stress management, adaptability, and wellbeing that compound over time, creating increasingly positive trajectories as careers progress.</p>

                    <p><strong>In this lesson, you'll:</strong> Complete comprehensive career resilience assessments evaluating your current practices, strengths, and development areas across multiple life domains, develop long-term mental health maintenance plans that evolve with career stages from early career through retirement transitions, practice scenario planning for anticipated challenges including industry disruptions, organizational changes, and personal life transitions, implement continuous learning systems that keep your workplace mental health skills current and effective, and build legacy practices that support not just your own resilience but also contribute to more mentally healthy workplaces for future generations.</p>
