                            <p><strong>Alex, 34, IT Project Manager</strong></p>
                            <p>Three major projects all due the same week. Boss kept adding "urgent" tasks. Team was understaffed. Alex was working 12-hour days, sleeping poorly, snapping at family. Felt completely out of control.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Monday morning:</strong> Scheduled 30-min meeting with boss</li>
                                <li><strong>The ask:</strong> "I have Projects A, B, and C all due Friday. I can deliver ALL of them IF we extend one to next Tuesday, OR I can prioritize 2 for Friday and delay 1 to next week. Which approach serves the company best?"</li>
                                <li><strong>Key move:</strong> Didn't say "I can't" - instead offered CHOICES and asked boss to prioritize</li>

                        </div>

                            <p><strong>Immediate result:</strong> Boss chose to extend Project B to Tuesday (it wasn't as urgent as he thought)</p>
                            <p><strong>2-week result:</strong> Alex delivered Projects A and C on Friday with QUALITY work instead of rushing all three poorly. Project B delivered Tuesday, better than if rushed Friday.</p>
                            <p><strong>Zone shift:</strong> High Strain → Active Learning (still high demands, but now had control over timeline)</p>

                            <h4>💡 Key Takeaway:</h4>
                            <p>You don't need to say "no." Just ask for help prioritizing. Most bosses don't realize they're overloading you until you SHOW them the conflict.</p>

                            <p>New manager reviewed EVERY email before sending, changed Jamie's work constantly, required 3 progress reports daily. Jamie felt like a robot - no creativity, no decisions, no autonomy. Started looking for new jobs.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Found small areas to control: reorganized desk, chose which project to start each morning, created own internal to-do list</li>
                                <li>Picked HOW to complete tasks even though manager dictated WHAT</li>
                                <li>Result: Felt 20% less "robot-like" - small but meaningful</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li><strong>Key move:</strong> Showed the manager Jamie's THINKING, not just results</li>
                                <li><strong>Wednesday updates:</strong> "A complete, went well. Moving to B using [method]."</li>

                            <h4>What Happened:</h4>
                            <p><strong>Week 3:</strong> Manager stopped asking for 3 daily reports - the Monday/Wednesday emails gave him the visibility he needed</p>
                            <p><strong>Week 6:</strong> Manager said "I trust your judgment on small decisions - just run big stuff by me"</p>
                            <p><strong>3-month result:</strong> Jamie now had approval to make decisions under $1000 without manager review. Still high demands, but now with meaningful control.</p>

                            <p><strong>What Priya did:</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>2 weeks before review (Strategic Visibility):</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Created "brag document" - listed ALL accomplishments from past year with metrics</li>
                                <li>Documented challenges she overcame and solutions she created</li>
                                <li>Gathered positive feedback emails from colleagues and clients</li>
                                <li><strong>Key move:</strong> Sent this to manager 1 week before review as "prep document"</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>3 days before review (Reframing):</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Old frame:</strong> "Review = judgment of my worth"</li>
                                <li><strong>New frame:</strong> "Review = data I can use to improve"</li>
                                <li><strong>Approach:</strong> "Even if I get criticism, I'm CHOOSING to treat it as useful information, not an attack"</li>
                                <li>Prepared 3 questions to ask: "What should I focus on developing next quarter?"</li>

                            <h4>What Happened:</h4>
                            <p><strong>During review:</strong> Manager referenced Priya's prep document multiple times - "I see you accomplished X, Y, Z..."</p>
                            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Review was 70% positive, 30% constructive feedback (vs last year's 80% criticism)</p>
                            <p><strong>Surprise:</strong> Manager said "I appreciate you taking ownership of your development - that document showed initiative"</p>
                            <p><strong>Mental shift:</strong> When constructive feedback came, Priya asked clarifying questions instead of getting defensive. Manager noted this as "growth" and "professional maturity."</p>
                            <p><strong>Zone shift:</strong> High Strain → Active Learning (review became growth conversation, not judgment)</p>

                            <h4>💡 Key Takeaway:</h4>
                            <p>You can't control WHAT feedback you get, but you CAN control WHAT YOU BRING to the conversation and HOW YOU RESPOND. Preparation = perceived control = less stress.</p>
                            <p class="takeaway-quote">"I walked in with evidence of my value. That completely changed the dynamic from 'being judged' to 'collaborative planning.'" - Priya</p>
