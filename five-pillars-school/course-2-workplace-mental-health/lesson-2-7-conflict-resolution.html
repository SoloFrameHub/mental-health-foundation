                <h2>Welcome to Mental Health-Aware Conflict Resolution</h2>
                <div class="introduction-content">
                    <p><strong>Welcome to transforming how you navigate workplace disagreements and tensions.</strong> Conflict resolution with mental health awareness recognizes that workplace conflicts don't just need resolution—they need to be handled in ways that protect and strengthen team members' psychological wellbeing. Unresolved or poorly managed conflicts represent major sources of workplace stress, contributing to 38% of employee turnover and costing organizations $359 billion annually in lost productivity. When conflicts are addressed skillfully with mental health awareness, they become opportunities to strengthen relationships, improve understanding, and build more resilient teams.</p>

                    <p><strong>The science is clear:</strong> Research from organizational psychology demonstrates that conflict activates threat-detection systems in the brain, with stress responses particularly intense for individuals already experiencing mental health challenges. However, studies show that constructive conflict resolution approaches reduce cortisol levels by 54% and improve team psychological safety scores by 43%. The Harvard Negotiation Project's research on principled negotiation demonstrates that separating people from problems and focusing on interests rather than positions creates outcomes that satisfy all parties while preserving dignity and relationships—essential for maintaining workplace mental health during disagreements.</p>

                    <p><strong>In this lesson, you'll:</strong> Complete conflict style assessments identifying your typical responses and how stress affects your conflict behavior, practice de-escalation techniques that reduce emotional intensity while maintaining productive dialogue, develop mental health-aware mediation skills that consider how anxiety, depression, or burnout influence conflict dynamics, implement interest-based negotiation approaches that find win-win solutions while protecting relationships, and build restorative practices that repair team bonds after conflicts and create stronger connections than existed before the disagreement.</p>
