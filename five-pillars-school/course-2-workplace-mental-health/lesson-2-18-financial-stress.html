                <h2>Welcome to Managing Financial Stress at Work</h2>
                <div class="introduction-content">
                    <p><strong>Welcome to breaking the destructive cycle between financial worry and work performance.</strong> Financial stress—concerns about money, debt, savings, and economic security—represents one of the most pervasive yet overlooked workplace mental health challenges. Research shows that 78% of workers report financial stress, with 46% spending 3+ hours weekly worrying about finances during work time. Financial stress reduces productivity by 34%, increases absenteeism by 51%, and correlates strongly with anxiety, depression, and burnout—creating a vicious cycle where money worries impair work performance, threatening the income needed to address financial concerns.</p>

                    <p><strong>The science is clear:</strong> Studies from the American Psychological Association and financial wellness research demonstrate that financial stress activates the same brain regions as physical pain, triggering chronic stress responses that impair cognitive function, decision-making, and emotional regulation. Organizations offering financial wellness programs report $3 return for every $1 invested through reduced turnover, improved productivity, and decreased healthcare costs. Research shows that even modest improvements in financial literacy and planning reduce workplace stress by 32% and improve job satisfaction by 28%, highlighting that addressing financial wellness isn't just personal—it's essential for workplace mental health and professional success.</p>

                    <p><strong>In this lesson, you'll:</strong> Complete financial stress assessments identifying how money concerns currently impact your mental health and work performance, learn foundational financial wellness concepts including budgeting, emergency fund building, and debt management strategies, practice stress management techniques specifically adapted for financial anxiety including cognitive reframing and worry scheduling, develop strategies for maintaining work performance despite financial concerns through compartmentalization and focus techniques, and build comprehensive financial wellness plans that address both immediate stress relief and long-term financial security supporting sustainable mental health.</p>
