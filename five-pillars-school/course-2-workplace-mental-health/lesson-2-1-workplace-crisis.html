                <div class="introduction-content">
                    <p><strong>Welcome to a transformative journey in workplace mental health awareness.</strong> In today's fast-paced professional environment, understanding the mental health crisis facing modern workplaces isn't just beneficial—it's essential for survival and success. With 76% of employees experiencing workplace stress that negatively impacts their mental health, and organizations losing $300 billion annually to stress-related issues, the workplace mental health crisis represents one of the most significant challenges facing professionals today.</p>

                    <p><strong>The science is clear:</strong> Research from the World Health Organization (WHO), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and Harvard Business School workplace studies demonstrates that workplace mental health interventions yield a remarkable $4 return for every $1 invested. Organizations with strong mental health cultures show 60% higher productivity, 3.5x higher employee engagement, and 67% reduction in burnout rates. Yet despite these compelling statistics, 60% of employees have never discussed their mental health concerns at work, perpetuating a cycle of silence that prevents early intervention and support.</p>

                    <p><strong>In this lesson, you'll:</strong> Complete a comprehensive workplace mental health assessment identifying your personal stress patterns and protective factors, explore the neuroscience of how workplace stress impacts brain function and performance, practice evidence-based interventions including stress monitoring, boundary-setting exercises, and recovery ritual development, and build a personalized 4-week foundation program that addresses your unique workplace mental health challenges while enhancing professional effectiveness.</p>
